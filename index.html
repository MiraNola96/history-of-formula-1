                <p class="paragraph-line">The 1950 Formula One season was the inaugural FIA Formula One World Championship season, which commenced on May 13, 1950, and ended on September 3 after 7 races. The championship consisted of six Formula One races in Europe plus the Indianapolis 500, which was run to AAA/USAC regulations. The first ever crowned champion of the official Formula 1 Series was none other than Giuseppe Farina, who collected a grand total of 30 pts. Giuseppe also want the previous year in 1949 before the start of the Formula 1 Series. Giuseppe would give Alpha Romeo their first ever Constructor win, which also labeled the famous car brand the "First ever team to win in Formula 1".

                Throughout the 1950's, we would see many amazing and notable drivers compete and win, but none more noteable than the great Juan Manuel Fangio. Juan Manuel Fangio,affectionately nicknamed El Chueco ("the bowlegged" or "bandy legged one") or El Maestro ("The Master" or "The Teacher"), was an Argentinian racing car driver. He dominated the first decade of Formula One racing, winning the World Drivers' Championship five times. He would drive from many notable racing teams to include Alpha Romeo, Maserati, Mercedes, and Ferrari. Both Farina and Fangio are depicted in the images on the right with Farina at the top, and Fangio on the bottom.

                <p class="paragraph-line">The 1960 Formula One season was the 14th season of the FIA's Formula One motor racing. It featured the 11th FIA World Championship of Drivers, the third International Cup for F1 Manufacturers and numerous non-championship Formula One races. The World Championship commenced on 7 February and ended on 20 November after ten races. In 1960, there were some significant rule changes, most notably in the points systems on how drivers would acrue points towards their championship title hopes. The points-scoring system was changed, with the point for the fastest lap being dropped and a point given for sixth place. The best six scores counted towards the championship increased from five from the previous season.

                Throughought the 1960's and 1970's there were so many great and notable legendary drivers to compete, but the ones that are the most notable are shown on the left hand side starting with Sir Jackie Stewart. Nicknamed the "Flying Scot", he competed in Formula One between 1965 and 1973, winning three World Drivers' Championships and twice finishing as runner-up over those nine seasons. Outside of Formula One, he narrowly missed out on a win at his first attempt at the Indianapolis 500 in 1966, and competed in the Can-Am series in 1970 and 1971. Between 1997 and 1999, in partnership with his son, Paul, he was team principal of the Stewart Grand Prix Formula One racing team. Next you have Jim Clark and his on trac rival Graham Hill. Clark, from Scotland, won two World Championships, in 1963 and 1965. A versatile driver, he competed in sports cars, touring cars and in the Indianapolis 500, which he won in 1965. He was particularly associated with the Lotus marque. He was killed in a Formula Two racing accident in 1968 in Hockenheim, in West Germany. Graham hill was a British racing driver and team owner, who was the Formula One World Champion twice, winning in 1962 and 1968 as well as being runner up on three occasions (1963, 1964 and 1965). Despite not passing his driving test until 1953 when he was already 24 years of age, and only entering the world of motorsports a year later, Hill would go on to become one of the greatest drivers of his generation. Hill is most celebrated for being the only driver ever to win the Triple Crown of Motorsport, an achievement which he defined as winning the Indianapolis 500, the 24 Hours of Le Mans, and the Formula One World Drivers' Championship.

                In 1970, the revolution of aerodynamic engineering began to take place. It started with the creation of wings, which meant more downforce for the cars. Essentially this meant they had more grip and could coast round corners much faster than previously. In the early days, the wings were not fastened particularly securely, and it wasn’t unheard of for them to fall off at unexpected moments. After a few too many accidents, wings were banned for a short time.

                In 1975, Ferrari began to make their comeback – despite the fact that the season was littered with protests about driver safety. In the Spanish race, a car came off the track and actually hit the crowd, killing four people, and causing some drivers to refuse to continue to participate.

                Ferrari driver Niki Lauda won five races and had nine pole starts to take his first championship. He went on to win two more. The next year, 1976, Lauda was involved in a horrific accident at the Nürburgring, which saw his car burst into flames. Lauda suffered facial burns and inhaled toxic gases, so much that he was not expected to survive. However, Lauda did manage to pull through and was miraculously driving again only six weeks later. The Nürburgring track was taken off the calendar, but returned in a dramatically altered and much shorter state.

                <p class="paragraph-line">The 80s & early 90s was the most competitive generation of drivers ever seen. Senna, Prost, Mansell, Piquet, Jones, Lauda, Hunt, & Schumacher all of which won championships in these era's. Berger, Alesi, Laffite, Watson, Pironi, Reuttemann, G.Villeneuve & Patrese all won races during this period. The leading drivers were all worshipped as heroes. From our heroes of these decades, one of the most incredible rivalries were born in that of Austrian driver Niki Lauda and his main competitor James Hunt, a British driver who drove for McLaren who won the 1976 championship, but only just. Lauda was leading the championship by 3 points in the last race, but had to retire after torrential rain. That handed the championship to Hunt, who finished the race in the terrible weather, without knowing where he had placed or if he had clinched the title. Lauda reclaimed the crown the next year in 1977, despite quitting the team with two races to go. The team calculated the position he needed to finish in to claim the title – 4th – at the US Grand Prix, and Lauda delivered and then joined Bernie Ecclestone’s Parmalat Brabham team.

                In development terms, the cars began to sport air boxes above their heads to increase flows around the engines. Engineers changed their titles to designers, and began to increase their knowledge of aerodynamics. The cars began to take shape, using a streamlined body and undertray developments to the downforce and speed things up. There developments were called “ground effects” and impressed a lot of the drivers.They were not without their problems though, because the new developments meant the setup of the car was incredibly important. One tiny degree the wrong way would mean the cars were unstable and ultimately not race worthy. F1 became a highly sophisticated balancing act. The effects were banned in 1983, to make F1 more about driver skill rather than car setup.
                </p>
                <p>
                The cars were monsters, in this era with v12s & 1000+ horsepower turbos filled the grid. During the 80s, the cars had minimal driver aids & electronics. In the early 90s we saw an arms race of techno-gadgets, culminating in the Williams FW14B, one of the fastest & most advanced race cars ever built. The cars ran special engines & tyres just for qualifying, designed to last a single lap. There was no overtaking aids (like the KERs & DRS systems thst are in use today to assist the drivers with passing today). Overtaking was done by sheer willpower & brute force as no-one would give an inch to the other out on the racing circuits. In the opening scene ofthe movie RUSH, Lauda is speaking to the viewers saying "25 drivers start every season in formula 1, and each year 2 of us die. What kind of person does a job like this? no normal man for sure. Rebels, lunatics, dreamers. people who are desperate to make a mark, and are prepared to die trying".
                </p>
                <p>
                It was a level playing field, where driver skill often made the difference. Some of the more interesting podium finishers during the era included Leyton House, Ligier, Larousse, Tyrell, Jordan, Sauber, Toleman & Lotus. In modern F1, its extremely rare for a team outside the top 5 to finish on the podium. We would also see the birth of who could be considered to be the greatest Formula 1 driver of all time as far as Championships, and victories are concerned, Michael Schumacher. In addition, we would also mourn the heavy loss of the late great Ayrton Senna, who died after a horrific accident duting a race. Senna too is considered one of the great legelnds of the sport, who had an incredible culture of success in Formula 1.</p>

                <p class="paragraph-line">The 2000s was a decade split into two. The first half utterly dominated by Ferrari and Michael Schumacher, breaking records as if for fun. The second half was the rise of Alonso, Hamilton and Button. But underneath it all it was an era of some incredible racing cars, wildly changing rules and screaming engines be them V10 or V8.
                </p>
                <p>
                While many years in the first half of the 2000s were a relative stroll for the pairing of Schumacher and Ferrari, the first year of the decade was a bit more tough. Yes Ferrari and Schumacher eventually took the first of five championship doubles but with four races of the season left McLaren had won as many races as Ferrari and Mika Hakkinen and David Coulthard were snapping at Schumacher’s heels.

                But then it all came together. The car was a development of the F300 and F399 Ferrari had campaigned in 1998 and ’99, but now had a much better weight distribution thanks to a brand new engine. Through the seasons it also received a reasonably large overhaul – with the initially angular front wing replaced and much bigger bargeboards arriving in mid-season. Schumacher then won four races in a row, almost cruising to the title, although it actually went down to the penultimate race. The key to the F1-2000’s legend is that it that title was the first for Ferrari in 21 years. 
                </p>
                <p>
                The car that ended that mighty F1 Ferrari run (six World Constructor’s Championships for Ferrari, five Drivers’ crowns for Schumacher), was the Renault R25, which was a masterpiece of clever engineering. It was, in reality, slower than McLaren’s MP4-20 at many points, and in fact the McLaren would win more races. But with much better reliability and Fernando Alonso just stepping up to his status as one of the best all-round drivers of his generation, it was the Renault that would prevail.

                While the R25 won as many races as its successor, the R26, and both won the Constructors’ and Drivers’ championships, but the R25 is most notable for the gact that it was able to snap Ferrari, and Schumachers winning streaks. The R25 won the first four races of the 2005 season, one for Giancarlo Fisichella, and three for eventual champion Alonso. But it was a consistency of podium finishes that would win the title for the Spaniard. Excluding the controversial US Grand Prix that year, Alonso only failed to finish one race and finished on the podium 15 times out of 19 races. It also had some pretty stiff opposition, with both McLaren and Ferrari building potentially race winning cars in 2005 (McLaren’s 2006 season was a bit of a disaster).
                </p>
                <p>
                During the course of the 2009 season the, Brawn BGP 001 was probably not the fastest cars, but was able to pull off one of the most incredible cinderalla stories in sporting history. The fact that the team had absolutely no money for the first half of the year and could not afford to put any real effort into developing the car would be the main reason why the car would not be considered the fastest on the grid. But the remarkable thing is that, even in a basically unchanged car, Jenson Button was able to win six of the first seven races in the 2009 Seaon.

                The Brawn BGP 001’s fairy story isn’t quite all it seems though. Yes the team had no money, yes it was saved by a management buyout that nearly involved Ross Brawn mortgaging his house, yes they continued to have no real cash for most of the season. But the BGP 001 may have been one of the best-developed cars on the grid when the year began. Honda had abandoned its disastrous 2008 car early, choosing to put all its efforts into the 2009 car, which was to be developed to completely new rules. The result was easily the fastest car on the grid and a trick diffuser that caused controversy. That Jenson Button being unable to win another race after that sixth win in Turkey wasn’t enough to stop him winning the title, shows just how incredible the BGP 001 was at the start of 2009. It does make you wonder what it would have been like had it had Honda branding and a full development season.

                <p class="paragraph-line">While the 2000s was a period of change creeping in, the 2010s saw the rulebook ripped up. F1 transformed beyond recognition from mid-decade, with a new sustainable agenda. Sebastian Vettel and Red Bull dominated F1 from 2010 to 2013. Adrian Newey had once again nailed the technical regulations, while Vettel’s deep understanding of his cars ensured he disappeared into the distance at most races. Several new teams arrived on the grid in 2010 under new proposed cost cap regulations. This never materialised, and all three teams had disappeared by 2017. HRT (Hispania) was hopelessly mismanaged, and its assets were sold. Lotus became Caterham but fell into administration at the end of 2016. Virgin Racing became Marussia, then Manor Racing. This was the only of the three teams to score a point, thanks to the late Jules Bianchi (Charles LeClerc'e Godfather). Manor was the last of the class of 2010 to fold at the end of 2016.  
                </p>
                <p>
                F1 also suffered from aesthetically challenged cars in the early 2010s. The most notable ones came in 2014. New lower front wing regulations meant designers needed to be novel when exploiting loopholes. 2014 saw the introduction of the current turbo-hybrid era. Hybrid engines replaced normally aspirated V8s. Customer engine deals had returned with a vengeance, as Renault, Mercedes and Ferrari provided power units to the grid. Highly complex turbo charged engines compared to the V8s we knew previously, pre-season testing saw reliability issues galore up and down the paddock. Ferrari powered teams suffered failures in Bahrain, but the engine was fast enough to be reasonably competitive. Renault on the other hand had a torrid pre-season, Red Bull and Lotus particularly affected. Mercedes were the only team to design their power unit alongside their chassis. This transformed the W05 into an iconic car not seen since 2004, and an utterly dominant one, with both cars on the pace. Once it became clear that the two drivers were going to be on their own out front most weekends, the management at Brackley decided to effectively split the garage in half. Both drivers would be given equal opportunities to race, and to win. What followed was a Titanic battle across 19 races between Lewis Hamilton and Nico Rosberg. 
                </p>
                <p>
                The results of Mercedes taking initiative to work on their power units before the rest of the grid before the 2014 season, would allow for complete and total dominance that would last until the end of the decade. As of 2022, Mercedes has won every Constructors Championship since 2014, along with providing Lewis Hamilton with 6 additional championships to the 1 that he won with McLaren in 2008. Mercedes' dominance from 2014-2021 allowed for another incredible legendary driver to be born where we would see the great Sir Lewis Hamilton achieve the unthinkable in serpassing Michael Schumachers records of most wins: 103, most pole positions: 103, and most podium finishes with 191. In 2021 we saw Red Bull's rising star Max Verstappen do the unthinkable of ending the Silver Arrow’s unbeaten run of Driver’s Championships, with one of the most controvercial race finishes in F1 history, and finding out later that the team went over the cost cap by 5% taking an unfair advantage over the field. Verstappens 2021 Victory stopped Lewis from surpassing Schumacher for most Drivers Titles by a single driver.
                </p>
                <p>
                At the end of the 2022 Red Bull had been able to do it again for the young Dutchman, who the year previous was crown the youngest F1 driver to ever win, by providing him with his second F1 Drivers Title and took the Constructors by storm as the new era of F1 is proving to be frustrating for the rest of the field. Throughout the seaon the only team to come close to compete was Ferrari, but were incapable of getting out of their own way with bad team decisions in races, and many engine malfunctions throughout the season. It took Mercedes some time, but were able to finially find a good footing with their cars and started seeing more podiums, and were ablt to get their young new star, George Russel, his first ever win in Brazil.</p>

Her racing career was impaired by a serious crash in 1936, and the events of World War II. Her efforts to resume racing after World War II was ruined by an unproven accusation of collaboration with the Nazis. She drove for Bugatti, and Alpha Romeo in at least 70 starts in her Formula 1 career.

                Lella Lombardi participated in 17 Formula One World Championship Grands Prix, debuting on 20 July 1974 and finishing her career with half a point. She is the only female Formula One driver in history to have a top six finish in a World Championship race, which she did at the 1975 Spanish Grand Prix. As well as being the sole female driver to score points in Formula One, she is one of two who qualified for a Formula One race.

                Desire Wilson is a former racing driver from South Africa and one of only five women to have competed in Formula One. She entered one Formula One World Championship Grand Prix in 1980 with a non-works RAM Racing-prepared Williams FW07, but failed to qualify. She became the only woman to win a Formula One race of any kind when she won at Brands Hatch in the short-lived British Aurora F1 Championship in 1980.

                Giovanna Amati is a former professional racing driver from Italy. She is the most recent female driver to have entered the Formula One World Championship. Brought up in a wealthy background, Amati was kidnapped in 1978 before being released on an 800 million lira ransom. She started her racing career in Formula Abarth series before moving up into Formula Three for 1985–86. An entry into Formula 3000 in 1987 brought little success but the following year, Amati improved her performances. In 1992, Amati became the fifth woman Formula One driver when she signed for Brabham.

                The W Series was publicly launched on 10 October 2018. Rumours about the creation of a female-only racing series had begun to circulate in November 2017. It was created in response to the lack of female drivers progressing to the highest levels of motorsport, particularly Formula 1. The series has the backing of a number of prominent members of the motorsport community, including former F1 driver David Coulthard and engineer Adrian Newey. For the inaugural season in 2019, all cars were operated by Hitech GP. The 2019 championship consisted of six races, all of which were run in Europe in support of the 2019 DTM. In September 2022, it was reported that the series is facing significant financial difficulties, as reported in the recent company accounts filed with Companies House on 5 September 2022, which showed that it had net liabilities of over £7.5 million to 31 December 2021, with debts to a number of creditors, including Whisper, the media production company owned by Jake Humphrey and David Coulthard, and Velocity Experience, the company that provides hospitality services to the series. Doubts were expressed whether it would be able to complete the 2022 season; these doubts were realized in October, when the two remaining W Series rounds after Singapore for 2022 were cancelled due to financial issues. CEO Catherine Bond Muir expressed confidence that the series would return in 2023.

                The W Series has faced criticism since it was publicly announced, with opponents of the series claiming the category segregated female racers rather than promoting their inclusion in established series.British IndyCar Series driver Pippa Mann responded to the series’ announcement on Twitter, saying "What a sad day for motorsport. Those with funding to help female racers are choosing to segregate them as opposed to supporting them. I am deeply disappointed to see such an historic step backwards take place in my life time."Mann's views on segregation were echoed by Charlie Martin, who stated "This series is founded on segregation, and while it may create opportunities for some female drivers, it sends a clear message that segregation is acceptable. We don’t discriminate in sport based on race, so it is particularly jarring that we feel it is acceptable to do so based on gender in 2018. As racers, we want to compete against the best drivers – regardless of age, race, sexual orientation or gender – and prove we are the best at what we do." Former Formula E and ex-Sauber F1 Test Driver Simona de Silvestro has suggested that the $1.5 million prize fund would be better invested in a scholarship system to support the development of talent across a wider range of motorsport disciplines. "If there’s really that much money going into the series, there are a few girls that have been pretty competitive in junior series. It seems like everyone is just struggling to get the shot. If you look at a Red Bull affiliation or a Mercedes affiliation, somehow these kids always get into the best teams and then they’re winning. I think, personally, it would have been better to do something like the Red Bull programme and make sure some girls get an opportunity on a really good team."

                <p class="paragraph-line">Formula 1 is the highest class of open-wheeled auto racing in the world, and is governed by the Federation Internationale de L'Automobile (FIA). Each year, the F1 world championship season is held, consisting of a set series of races around the world known as Grand Prix. Races are conducted on both purpose-built, and closed city streets. At the end of every racing season there are 2 championship itles that are at stake. One is specifically for the driver who finishes first with the most points by the end of the season, and the second is for the team, or constructor/manufacturer, that finishes with the most points at the end of the season.

                Constructors are people, or corporate entities which design key parts of Formula 1 cars that have competed in an FIA World Championship. Each Formula 1 team consists of 2 cars and 2 drivers, and the closer to victory each driver is at the end of a race, the more points a team recieves towards their Constructors Championship title. This also applies to the drivers as well as they recieve the same amount of points that they recieved for the team based upon their individual position in the race, and is applied to their individual Drivers Championship. Points can only be scored if drivers place their car within the Top 10 at the end of each race. The victor gets the maximum amount of points which is 25, and the 10th place finisher achieves 1 point. Where the two drivers finish in a race can be crucial to a team that is competing in the middle of the pack, as the closer a team is to winning the Constructors Cup a team comes, the more money they are awarded at the end of the season, to put towards the next year.
