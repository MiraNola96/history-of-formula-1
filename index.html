                <p>The 1950 Formula One season was the inaugural FIA Formula One World Championship season, which commenced on May 13, 1950, and ended on September 3 after 7 races. The championship consisted of six Formula One races in Europe plus the Indianapolis 500, which was run to AAA/USAC regulations. The first ever crowned champion of the official Formula 1 Series was none other than Giuseppe Farina, who collected a grand total of 30 pts. Giuseppe also want the previous year in 1949 before the start of the Formula 1 Series. Giuseppe would give Alpha Romeo their first ever Constructor win, which also labeled the famous car brand the "First ever team to win in Formula 1".

                Throughout the 1950's, we would see many amazing and notable drivers compete and win, but none more noteable than the great Juan Manuel Fangio. Juan Manuel Fangio,affectionately nicknamed El Chueco ("the bowlegged" or "bandy legged one") or El Maestro ("The Master" or "The Teacher"), was an Argentinian racing car driver. He dominated the first decade of Formula One racing, winning the World Drivers' Championship five times. He would drive from many notable racing teams to include Alpha Romeo, Maserati, Mercedes, and Ferrari. Both Farina and Fangio are depicted in the images on the right with Farina at the top, and Fangio on the bottom.

                <p>The 1960 Formula One season was the 14th season of the FIA's Formula One motor racing. It featured the 11th FIA World Championship of Drivers, the third International Cup for F1 Manufacturers and numerous non-championship Formula One races. The World Championship commenced on 7 February and ended on 20 November after ten races. In 1960, there were some significant rule changes, most notably in the points systems on how drivers would acrue points towards their championship title hopes. The points-scoring system was changed, with the point for the fastest lap being dropped and a point given for sixth place. The best six scores counted towards the championship increased from five from the previous season.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                Additionally it was the last year the World Championship would include the United States most famous auto-motive event, the Indianapolis 500 and the last season, which saw a victory for a front-engined car in a World Championship race. In this season we would see three drivers die on a Grand Prix racing weekend. American Harry Schell would pass in a non-championship race at Silverstone, and Britons Chris Bristow & Alan Stacey, both killed at the Belgian Grand Prix at Spa-Francorchamps.

                Throughought the 1960's and 1970's there were so many great and notable legendary drivers to compete, but the ones that are the most notable are shown on the left hand side starting with Sir Jackie Stewart. Nicknamed the "Flying Scot", he competed in Formula One between 1965 and 1973, winning three World Drivers' Championships and twice finishing as runner-up over those nine seasons. Outside of Formula One, he narrowly missed out on a win at his first attempt at the Indianapolis 500 in 1966, and competed in the Can-Am series in 1970 and 1971. Between 1997 and 1999, in partnership with his son, Paul, he was team principal of the Stewart Grand Prix Formula One racing team. Next you have Jim Clark and his on trac rival Graham Hill. Clark, from Scotland, won two World Championships, in 1963 and 1965. A versatile driver, he competed in sports cars, touring cars and in the Indianapolis 500, which he won in 1965. He was particularly associated with the Lotus marque. He was killed in a Formula Two racing accident in 1968 in Hockenheim, in West Germany. Graham hill was a British racing driver and team owner, who was the Formula One World Champion twice, winning in 1962 and 1968 as well as being runner up on three occasions (1963, 1964 and 1965). Despite not passing his driving test until 1953 when he was already 24 years of age, and only entering the world of motorsports a year later, Hill would go on to become one of the greatest drivers of his generation. Hill is most celebrated for being the only driver ever to win the Triple Crown of Motorsport, an achievement which he defined as winning the Indianapolis 500, the 24 Hours of Le Mans, and the Formula One World Drivers' Championship.

                In 1970, the revolution of aerodynamic engineering began to take place. It started with the creation of wings, which meant more downforce for the cars. Essentially this meant they had more grip and could coast round corners much faster than previously. In the early days, the wings were not fastened particularly securely, and it wasn’t unheard of for them to fall off at unexpected moments. After a few too many accidents, wings were banned for a short time.

                In 1975, Ferrari began to make their comeback – despite the fact that the season was littered with protests about driver safety. In the Spanish race, a car came off the track and actually hit the crowd, killing four people, and causing some drivers to refuse to continue to participate.

                Ferrari driver Niki Lauda won five races and had nine pole starts to take his first championship. He went on to win two more. The next year, 1976, Lauda was involved in a horrific accident at the Nürburgring, which saw his car burst into flames. Lauda suffered facial burns and inhaled toxic gases, so much that he was not expected to survive. However, Lauda did manage to pull through and was miraculously driving again only six weeks later. The Nürburgring track was taken off the calendar, but returned in a dramatically altered and much shorter state.

                Niki Lauda’s main competition came in the form of James Hunt, a British driver for McLaren. He won the 1976 championship, but only just. Lauda was leading the championship by 3 points in the last race, but had to retire after torrential rain. That handed the championship to Hunt, who finished the race in the terrible weather, without knowing where he had placed or if he had clinched the title.

                Lauda reclaimed the crown the next year in 1977, despite quitting the team with two races to go. The team calculated the position he needed to finish in to claim the title – 4th – at the US Grand Prix, and Lauda delivered and then joined Bernie Ecclestone’s Parmalat Brabham team.

                In development terms, the cars began to sport air boxes above their heads to increase flows around the engines. Engineers changed their titles to designers, and began to increase their knowledge of aerodynamics. The cars began to take shape, using a streamlined body and undertray developments to the downforce and speed things up. There developments were called “ground effects” and impressed a lot of the drivers.

                They were not without their problems though, because the new developments meant the setup of the car was incredibly important. One tiny degree the wrong way would mean the cars were unstable and ultimately not race worthy. F1 became a highly sophisticated balancing act. Eventually, the effects were banned in 1983, to make F1 more about driver skill and less about car setup.

                <p>Formula 1 is the highest class of open-wheeled auto racing in the world, and is governed by the Federation Internationale de L'Automobile (FIA). Each year, the F1 world championship season is held, consisting of a set series of races around the world known as Grand Prix. Races are conducted on both purpose-built, and closed city streets. At the end of every racing season there are 2 championship itles that are at stake. One is specifically for the driver who finishes first with the most points by the end of the season, and the second is for the team, or constructor/manufacturer, that finishes with the most points at the end of the season. 
                    <br>
                    <br>
                Constructors are people, or corporate entities which design key parts of Formula 1 cars that have competed in an FIA World Championship. Each Formula 1 team consists of 2 cars and 2 drivers, and the closer to victory each driver is at the end of a race, the more points a team recieves towards their Constructors Championship title. This also applies to the drivers as well as they recieve the same amount of points that they recieved for the team based upon their individual position in the race, and is applied to their individual Drivers Championship. Points can only be scored if drivers place their car within the Top 10 at the end of each race. The victor gets the maximum amount of points which is 25, and the 10th place finisher achieves 1 point. Where the two drivers finish in a race can be crucial to a team that is competing in the middle of the pack, as the closer a team is to winning the Constructors Cup a team comes, the more money they are awarded at the end of the season, to put towards the next year.
